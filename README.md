### **Domain of Interest:** _Climate Change_

##### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
- Climate change is a really relevant topic today and is a problem that needs to be solved. It’s also a global crisis that a lot of countries are facing. It is important to understand what are the factors that are contributing to global warming, as well as its impact on the world.

##### What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain (share **at least 3**)?
- This data driven project explores data to analyze and refine future climate predictions.
https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189519
- This data driven project explores different indicators and their effect on a country’s overall climate.
https://climateactiontracker.org/data-portal/
- This is a project based on the waste production across different countries in 2019.

##### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share **at least 3**)?
- Which part of the world is being affected by global warming the most?
- What factors are contributing the most to climate change?
- Is there a correlation between how much a country invests in recycling and climate change rates?
- Is there a correlation between how much waste a country produces and the climate change rates?


### **Finding Data:**

##### Climate change: _Earth Surface Temperature Database_
- https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data#GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv
- All of the raw data came from the Berkeley Earth data page. They collected the data by analyzing global climate models and generated raw data from their findings.
- Rows: 577462
- Columns: 4
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
  - Which part of the world is being affected by global warming the most?
    - The question can be answered by comparing the surface temperature across different countries within the data set.

##### What a Global Waste Database
- https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/what-waste-global-database
- The dataset is collected by the What a Waste global project about waste management across the globe, which includes composition, collection, disposal, waste generation, information on user information, legal information and more. The collection methods include current literature and conversations with waste agencies.
- Rows: 218
- Columns: 54
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
  - Is there a correlation between how much a country invests in recycling and climate change rates?
    - This question can be answered by the recycling rate and the percent of recycling within each country and compare with the surface temperature to determine if there is a correlation that higher recycling rate correlates to lower surface temperature in a country.  
  - What factors are contributing the most to climate change?
    - This question can be answered by what indicators (transportation, emission, agriculture…) contribute the most to global warming across different countries and see what is the most common indicator out of all the factors.


##### Climate Action Tracker Database
- https://climateactiontracker.org/data-portal/
- The data is collected by two organizations, Climate Analytics and the New Climate Institute. This data tracks government climate action and measures it against the aim of the Paris Agreement. The raw data set includes data from a multitude of  countries on the effects a factor has on the change in climate.
- Rows: 37626
- Columns: 8
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
  - Is there a correlation between how much waste a country produces and the climate change rates?
    - This dataset organizes the changes in global temperature in relation to the factor. Included in this is waste production, which allows us to see the correlation between waste production and the climate change rates in a given country.
  - What factors are contributing the most to climate change?
    - Each of the countries are organized by the type of factor, which would allow us to compare varying factors across multiple countries to see which contributes the most to climate change.
